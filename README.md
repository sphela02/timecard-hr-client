## Initial Component installation

After cloning in the Git repo, you will need to put a few pieces in place to get to work.

### Git Submodules

You will most likely have some Git Submodules with this framework, you'll need to initialize and update them.
`git submodule init`
`git submodule update --remote`

### Install Node.js and NPM

## Run the Development server to see if all is good!

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.  There is an npm command `npm start` which will start the dev server and launch your browser (equivalent to `ng serve -o`)
